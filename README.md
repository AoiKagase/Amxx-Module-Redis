# AMX MOD X - Redis Client Module
This is a module for amxmodx that allows operations from HLDS to the Redis data store.

# W.I.P
- Help me set up a compiling environment for Windows.
- It also does not support automatic compilation of the external libraries hiredis and redis-plus-plus.
- I don't think I can implement these.
